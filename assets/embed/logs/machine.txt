(LOG HAS BEEN TRANSCRIBED FROM DEVICE HEADPHONE-RD-2254-AN-ST)
I got that speaker unit home, found some spare parts that fit well,
soldered some components on, and got this thing functioning.
It seems to be one of those sentient computer robots like my previous one.
Little bastard had a mind of its own, broke my window and escaped.
I'll talk about HIM later. Anyway this thing has a terminal, ran an about command.
This thing has a 1.2 Terabyte SSD and it's username is.. "QT3.14" Wonder why.
I'll try and see if this thing can run some programs, could help a lot.
If you wanna see the log to that thing, just run "log qt314".
