BEGIN LOG "PICKUP"

(LOG HAS BEEN TRANSCRIBED FROM DEVICE HEADPHONE-RD-2254-AN-ST)
While browsing a local junkyard, I noticed a little speaker unit that came with a monitor,
dunno where this ever came from or whoever owned it or made it even.
I'm gonna talk with the owner to see if he agrees on a price or hell, even get it for free even.
Probably going to upgrade it along the way just to see if this dang thing
even works. It's pretty heavy so I also might need someone else to carry it.
Either way could use it to play my music or store some files my internet wont let me upload.
Curse you Internet Service Provider! Overpriced and shitty, won't even let me pirate.
C'mon, you shouldve let me slide when pirating that damn copy of Premiere Pro.
Either way, ill wrap this up and try to fix this damn thing.
