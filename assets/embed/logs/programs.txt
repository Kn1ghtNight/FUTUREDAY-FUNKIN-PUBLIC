THIS THING RUNS MARIO KART WII??? NO SERIOUSLY IT DOES THAT,
I RAN DOLPHIN FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES AND IT WORKS. Good to know.
Anyway, this thing talks too. I detatched the monitor,
and made it be able to move around by itself. It isn't dependant on speakers anymore.
Probably the last log I'll do with this.
